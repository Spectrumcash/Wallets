# Wallets
The Update is MANDATORY all wallets not on V2 will be disconnected from the Spectrum Network

SpectrumCash V2 Releases Notes: List of modifications/improvments:

1°) We will stop POW at block 200,000. SpectrumCash will become a full POS/MN coin.

2°) Changes the Staking Algorithm (the rewards will decrease around 5% each 6 months from 33% to 5%):

Block 0 to Block 300,000 => Staking rewards = 33 % annual 

Block 300,000 to Block 600,000 => Staking rewards = 25 % annual

Block 600,000 to Block 900,000 => Staking rewards = 20 % annual 

Block 900,000 to Block 1,200,000 => Staking rewards = 15 % annual

Block 1,200,000 to Block 1,500,000 => Staking rewards = 10 % annual 

Block 1,500,000 to Block 1,800,000 => Staking rewards = 8 % annual 

After Block 1,800,000 => Staking rewards = 5 % annual

3°) Wallet now supports Multi-MN.

4°) Wallet is now Multi-Themed. This allows users to customize the wallet background and look/feel.

5°) Seeds were added for better network synchronization.
